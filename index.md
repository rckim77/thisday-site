# Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 25, 2026

This Day ("we", "us", or "our") helps you review photos and videos from prior years so you can clean up storage in small daily batches.

This Privacy Policy explains what information This Day accesses, how it is used, and your choices.

## 1. Scope

This Privacy Policy applies to the This Day iOS app.

## 2. Information We Access and Process

### a) Photos and videos (on-device)

If you grant Photos permission, This Day accesses your Photos library on your device to:

- Find items from the same calendar day across prior years
- Show thumbnails and details so you can review content
- Detect exact duplicates within surfaced results
- Delete items only when you explicitly choose delete actions
- Export selected items to the iOS share sheet when you explicitly choose share actions

We do not require account creation to use the app.

### b) Notification settings

If you enable reminders, This Day stores your reminder preferences (enabled state, hour, minute) and schedules local notifications on your device.

### c) Local app preferences and progress

This Day stores app settings and progress locally on your device, including values such as:

- Years to show
- Sort and appearance preferences
- Streak and milestone progress
- Total deleted storage counter

### d) Feedback email

If you use "Send Feedback," your mail app opens a draft addressed to us. Any information you send in that email is provided by you voluntarily.

## 3. How We Use Information

We use accessed or stored information only to provide and improve core app functionality, including:

- Showing relevant daily memories
- Enabling deletion and sharing actions you request
- Providing reminders and streak/milestone progress
- Responding to support or feedback emails

## 4. Data Sharing

We do not sell your personal data.

We do not use third-party advertising SDKs in This Day.

We do not upload your photo/video library to our own servers as part of normal app use.

Data may leave your device only when you explicitly choose to share content via iOS sharing destinations, or when Apple processes device-level services you use (for example, iCloud Photos).

## 5. Retention and Deletion

Because core app data is stored on-device, you can remove it by uninstalling the app or resetting app preferences where available.

Photo/video deletion actions are performed through Apple Photos APIs and follow Apple Photos behavior (for example, items may move to "Recently Deleted" before permanent removal).

## 6. Security

We rely on Apple platform protections and process your Photos library data on-device for core features.

No method of storage or transmission is fully secure, but we design This Day to minimize data exposure by avoiding unnecessary data collection and server storage.

## 7. Children's Privacy

This Day is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## 8. International Users

If you contact us, your communication may be processed in countries where we or our service providers operate.

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Last updated" date above.
